## add_to_temporary_list
Saves a temporary target for use during the trigger execution  
This is used to build lists in triggers.  
If used within an any-trigger, placement within the trigger is quite important. The game will iterate through every instance of the any-trigger until it finds a single instance that fulfills the requirements, and then it will stop.  
In order to add every instance of a scope that fulfills certain conditions, use "count = all" while also placing this "effect" at the very end of the any-trigger (so that every condition is evaluated for every iteration).
